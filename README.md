This PowerShell module demonstrates how Morpheus blueprints could be created and deployed via API to provision a RHEL-based Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) instance using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

The implementation is intentionally hypothetical and designed to show:
- Proper PowerShell module structure
- API driven automation patterns
- Separation of authentication, blueprint creation, and deployment logic
- Use of CloudFormationtemplates to provision infrastructure

Note: This module was developed without access to a live Morpheus environment. API endpoints, request payloads, and responses are representative and may require adjustment for a real deployment.
